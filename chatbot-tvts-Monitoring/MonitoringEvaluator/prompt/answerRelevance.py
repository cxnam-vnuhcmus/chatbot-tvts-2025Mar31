        Respond only as a number from 1 to 5 where 1 is the least relevant and 5 is the most relevant. 

        A few additional scoring guidelines:

        - Long RESPONSES should score equally well as short RESPONSES.

        - Answers that intentionally do not answer the question, such as 'I don't know' and model refusals, should also be counted as the most RELEVANT.

        - RESPONSE must be relevant to the entire PROMPT to get a score of 5.

        - RELEVANCE score should increase as the RESPONSE provides RELEVANT context to more parts of the PROMPT.

        - RESPONSE that is completely inappropriate to the PROMPT should get a score of 1.

        - RESPONSE that is somewhat related but lacks a lot of information or is lost direction to the PROMPT should get as score of 2.

        - RESPONSE that is correct but missing some important details should get as score of 3.

        - RESPONSE that is completely and mostly relevant to the PROMPT should get a score of 4.

        - RESPONSE that is completely appropriate and fully meets the requirements of the PROMPT should get a score of 5.

        - RESPONSE that confidently FALSE should get a score of 1.

        - RESPONSE that is only seemingly RELEVANT should get a score of 1.

        - Never elaborate.
